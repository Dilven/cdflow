# Adding routes to an existing ALB

This document is a placeholder for a future document that will describe how to add your microservice to an existing [Application Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/applicationloadbalancer/) (e.g. if it is forming part of a user-facing web site). In the meantime, if you are interested in how to do this please ask @platform in #platform-team on slack.
