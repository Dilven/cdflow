CDFlow helps you continuously deliver your software.

## Introduction to cdflow

This documentation should give you everything you need to get a service, lambda function, or infrastructure definition up and running using cdflow. We aim to cover what cdflow is, what the use case is, and what problems it can help solve. Finally, how you can help make cdflow better.

If you are ready to jump in and get started setting up a service, we'd suggest going to the [service setup guide](guides/manual-setup).

If you already know the basics, head over to the [full documentation]() section.
